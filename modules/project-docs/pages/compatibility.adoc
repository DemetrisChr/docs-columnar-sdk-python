=== Network Requirements

== Capella Columnar Compatibility


Capella Columnar is a fully hosted service, continually updated, and offering the latest version --
with users having a few weeks to upgrade from the previous version.
As such, the latest Couchbase Columnar SDKs are tested against the latest versions.
Where older versions of the {name-sdk) pre-date significant new features in Columar, those differences will be noted in this section.


To make development easier, the SDK includes the Capella client certificate ready installed.
