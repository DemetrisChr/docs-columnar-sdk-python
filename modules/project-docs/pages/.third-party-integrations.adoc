=== Pandas DataFrame Support

DataFrames can be made from the JSON returned by the Columnar SDK, with something like this:

[source,python]
----
# Execute the Columnar query
res = cluster.execute_query(statement)

# Read the results into JSON
all_rows = res.get_all_rows()

# Create a Pandas DataFrame (it will infer schema)
df = pandas.read_json(all_rows)
----

Specific examples can be seen on the xref:howtos:sqlpp-queries-with-sdk.adoc[Columnar SDK Query page].


// Conversion for Arrow and other similar libraries is almost certainly equally possible.
